# Prodigy_ML_01 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Iris Dataset 🌸

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the **Iris dataset**. It is developed as part of the **Prodigy InfoTech Machine Learning Internship** task.

## 📊 Overview

The goal of this project is to:
- Load and inspect the Iris dataset.
- Perform univariate and multivariate analysis.
- Visualize relationships between features using plots like histograms, pairplots, boxplots, and violin plots.
- Understand the data distribution across different species of iris flowers.

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 📁 Files

- `Prodigy_ML_01.ipynb` – The main notebook that contains EDA code and visualizations.
- `README.md` – Project description and information.

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

- How to perform EDA on a classical dataset.
- How to use pandas and seaborn for visualization and analysis.
- Importance of data visualization in machine learning workflows.
